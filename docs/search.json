I am interested in the drivers of tactical variation, including how third-party and external state intervention in the conflict changes groups’ incentives to use violent or non-violent tactics.  Prior to starting my PhD, I worked on the Global Peace Index with the Institute for Economics and Peace, as an analyst with the Australian Department of Defence, and on the Asia Power Index with the Lowy Institute."

    "text": "This course provides an introduction to research methods and quantitative research in political science.\nTeaching materials\nThe course has two main goals. The first is to enable students to read and evaluate political science research that uses quantitative methods. The second is to prepare students for more advanced methodology courses. In addition, you will learn how to apply basic quantitative methods to political questions and acquire basic knowledge of the statistical software program R. The class will meet twice a week—lectures with the instructor and lab sessions with the teaching assistant. The lab sessions are designed to teach students how to use the statistical program R for data analysis, review homework assignments and exams, and answer any questions about the substantive material covered in the class lectures."
