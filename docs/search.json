Despite this, many referendums are considered failures by the movements (revealing a dearth of support), some are marred by violence, and few garner external backing. Given this, when are they likely to be employed? We argue that internal competition serves as one driving force for actors to use referendums as a way to gain or uphold status within the movement. Using novel data and two case studies, we highlight the ways these movements arrive at a vote for self-rule, underscoring the role of internal competition.\n\n\nCoding with the machines: machine-assisted coding of rare event data (2024)\nIn Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\nWith Henry David Overos, Roman Hlatky, Ojashwi Pathak, Jordan Gouws-Dewar, Katy Smith, Keith Padraic Chew, Jóhanna K Birnir, and Amy H Liu\nWhile machine coding of data has dramatically advanced in recent years, the literature raises significant concerns about validation of LLM classification showing, for example, that reliability varies greatly by prompt and temperature tuning, across subject areas and tasks—especially in “zero-shot” applications. This paper contributes to the discussion of validation in several different ways. To test the relative performance of supervised and semi-supervised algorithms when coding political data, we compare three models’ performances to each other over multiple iterations for each model and to trained expert coding of data. We also examine changes in performance resulting from prompt engineering and pre-processing of source data. To ameliorate concerns regarding LLM’s pre-training on test data, we assess performance by updating an existing dataset beyond what is publicly available. Overall, we find that only GPT-4 approaches trained expert coders when coding contexts familiar to human coders and codes more consistently across contexts. We conclude by discussing some benefits and drawbacks of machine coding moving forward.\n\n\nPlenty of Fish in the Sea (working paper)\nThis paper examines how how third-party states’ ability to fill trade gaps left by economic sanctions influences whether sanctions are imposed in the first place. It argues that sanctions are less likely when the target state can easily find alternative markets for the specific goods being restricted, as this undermines the sanctions’ effectiveness. By focusing on product-specific trade networks, rather than broad economic ties, the study offers a more nuanced understanding of when and why sanctions are used. This research is important as it sheds light on why some states evade sanctions and highlights the importance of global trade networks in shaping economic statecraft. The findings have significant implications for how states wield sanctions to achieve geopolitical goals in an interconnected world.\n\n\nTactics of Survival: Strategies of Resistance Data Project Update (forthcoming)\nWith Kathleen Cunningham, Ted Ellsworth, Michael Cowan, Oja Pathak, and Ellin Chung\nThis data feature presents the updated Strategies of Resistance Datas Project (SRDP), which provides organization-level data on duration of claim-making activity, violent and nonviolent tactics, demands over self-determination, and accommodations by the state. In the original data release, key comparisons were drawn between uses of mass nonviolence and smaller-scale nonviolent tactics, highlighting how common nonviolent direct action is, the extent to which it co-occurs with violence, and what we miss by examining only mass nonviolent campaigns. In the update, which includes new organizational-level data to 2020, we demonstrate how these data can be leveraged to understand and uniquely test hypotheses about organizational survival. Evaluating a set of hypotheses about the correlates of organizational survival drawn from the literature, we find that nonviolent tactical diversity is associated with longer survival and accommodation of the self-determination movements is associated with quicker exit."

    "text": "I am working on a number of projects to help teams of researchers incorporate machine-learning models into their events data coding. I have had the most success using GPT models to help locate relevant news articles and to extract relevant details from those relevant news articles.\nI have also produced a number of Shiny applications that help speed up human coding or verification of ML-models’ outputs and reduce human error.\n\nWorking papers\nCoding with the machines: machine-assisted coding of rare event data, with Johanna Birnir, Ernesto Calvo, Keith Chew, Jordan Dewar, Roman Hlatky, Amy Liu, Henry Overos, and Ojashwi Pathak.\nWhile machine coding of data has dramatically advanced in recent years, we do not know the relative performance of supervised and semi-supervised algorithms when coding political data – especially when compared to human coding. In this note, we juxtapose (1) a semi-supervised dictionary-based classifier with (2) an out-of-the-box GPT 4 model and (3) a fine-tuned BERT transformer – and compare all three to human coding of rare events data. We find that the transformer models outperform the bag-of-words approach, especially when fine tuned. None of the models beat human coding – but only in well-known contexts. Our results, however, suggest that the transformers do better than humans in less familiar contexts and that with additional training they can rapidly close the remaining gap to humans. We conclude by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of machine coding.\n\n\nPresentations\n\nUMD Methods Workshop (Fall 2023)\nDo you research political events, including protests, mediation, voting, or sanctions? Our traditional method for collecting these events data involves reading thousands of news articles to extract the relevant information and put it into a dataset that we can use for our analysis. This process is very time-consuming and can be prone to error. Happily, advanced large language models, including GPT, can assist us. These models are easy to use in R and can be seamlessly integrated into your data collection process. I will step through how to use out-of-the-box GPT models in R to extract useful information from news articles. You can use these models to extract information from thousands of news articles in mere minutes."
