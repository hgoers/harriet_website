The course has two main goals. The first is to enable students to read and evaluate political science research that uses quantitative methods. The second is to prepare students for more advanced methodology courses. In addition, you will learn how to apply basic quantitative methods to political questions and acquire basic knowledge of the statistical software program R. The class will meet twice a week---lectures with the instructor and lab sessions with the teaching assistant. The lab sessions are designed to teach students how to use the statistical program R for data analysis, review homework assignments and exams, and answer any questions about the substantive material covered in the class lectures.
