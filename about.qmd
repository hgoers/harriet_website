I am a PhD student in the [Department of Government and Politics](https://gvpt.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). I research how small- and middle-sized countries leverage their economic power. I am also an adjunct with the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/), where I research critical minerals supply chain vulnerabilities and opportunities for international cooperation in this space.<br><br>Prior to starting my PhD, I worked on the [Global Peace Index](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#/) with the [Institute for Economics and Peace](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/), as an analyst with the Australian Department of Defence, and on the [Asia Power Index](https://power.lowyinstitute.org/) with the [Lowy Institute](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/).
