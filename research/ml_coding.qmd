I am working on a number of projects to help teams of researchers incorporate machine-learning models into their events data coding. I have had the most success using GPT models to help locate relevant news articles and to extract relevant details from those relevant news articles.

I have also produced a number of Shiny applications that help speed up human coding or verification of ML-models' outputs and reduce human error.
