title: "Trade Dependence"
---

## Research interest

I focus on how states can use their dominant market position to extract political concessions from other states. To do this, I am developing a novel measure of trade dependence.

## Working papers

*A Novel Commodity-Level Measure of Trade Dependence.*

*Why Can't We Be Friends? The WTO's Role in Promoting Trade.*
